# Initializing the service

Initializing the service is really easy. It tries to get as much information as possible, but all properties can be changed accordingly. The service is automatically registered in the Catel service locator. 

Use the code to initialize the service by letting the service injected into a view model or resolve it manually from the service locator, then call this code:

    googleAnalyticsService.AccountId = AccountId;

# Customizing user ID

The user id is retrieved from the *IUserIdService*. By default, it uses a combination of the CPU id and the HDD id and hashes a combination of these 2 so they cannot be traced back to the user.

It can be customized by creating a custom *IUserIdService* or by setting the *UserId* property manually on the *IGoogleAnalyticsService*.

# Sending data
